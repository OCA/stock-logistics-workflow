Handle boxes/kits of components, that can be moved as a package,
but have the stock managed at the individual components.
This allows, for example, to track the serial numbers for the individual components.

Example:

- "Widget" is received in a box, containing Parts A, B and C.
  Parts A and B are serial number controlled, but part C is not.
  The serial numbers are barcoded and in the box labels.
- When receiving, we want to select the Kit product,
  type the quantity to receive, and then scan the barcodes for each box.

Configuration
=============

Requires the Manufacturing app, as it is used for products with a Kit BOM.
Configure the products to handle with a Kit BoM.
The Kit BoM components may be tracked by serial number or lot.

Usage
=====

To receive, on the Stock Receipt:

- On the "Stock Receipt", click on "Receive Kit" button to open the "Receive Kit" wizard.
- On the "Receive Kit" form header, select the Kit Product and the Quantity to receive.
  This will populate the lines with the components to be received,
  with the received quantity already populated.
- On the "Receive Kit" form lines, enter the serial/lot number for each line.
  This is done processing each box, and then each component in each box.
- Finally, click "Done" to add the received items to the Stock Receipt.
  Each Kit will automatically be put in a box.
  The box name is the serial/lot number of the first component, if it is tracked.
