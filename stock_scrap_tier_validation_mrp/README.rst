This module fixes compatibility between ``stock_scrap_tier_validation``
and the ``mrp`` module from Odoo. When scrapping products directly from
the production order form, the scrap record will open in the main window
rather than in a popup form.

This solves a technical issue with the validation flow: it is only after
saving a record that validation can be requested, whereas in the case of
a popup window the record is only saved when closing the window. If
validation is required, this attempt to save the record will raise an
exception.
