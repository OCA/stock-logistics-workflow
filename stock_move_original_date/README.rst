This module adds the *Original Date Scheduled* to stock moves. This is useful for
past analysis and warehouse performance reports.

In standard Odoo, once a transfer is confirmed with an scheduled date, this date
can still change to reflect changes in the planning (e.g. you receive a
notification from your supplier that goods will arrive a couple of days later).
In such situation you lost precious information of the originally planned date
that can be used to compute the real delay in the receipt from your supplier.

Usage
=====

#. Create a new transfer and assign an scheduled date.
#. Mark the transfer as to-do.
#. Change the scheduled date.
#. Original scheduled date is kept unchanged.
