This module add a "Start" button on the picking form view.
This button will start the picking process by setting the "printed" field to True.

By setting the "printed" field to True, we prevent the system to add new moves
to the picking.

Optionally, you can also delay the assignation of the picking's responsible
by setting the "Assign responsible at stock picking start" option to True into
the stock settings.
