return more items than it was in the original picking.

Use Cases / Context
===================

By default Odoo doesn't enforce any limit on item quantity that can be
returned in picking. It means that it is possible to return more items
that there were in the original picking. Eg if you delivered 5 pcs of
"Acoustic Block Screens" in picking you can return 8 pcs of it. This
module implements constraint with allows to return not more than the
original amount of item in the picking. It also takes into account
existing returns for the same picking. Eg if you delivered 5 pcs of
"Acoustic Block Screens" in picking then you can return no more than 5
pcs of it. If you have already returned 2 pcs in the same picking then
you can return no more than 3 pcs.
