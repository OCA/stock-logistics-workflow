==================================
Link between invoices and pickings
==================================

This module adds a link between pickings and invoices.
So that user can easily reach the invoices related to the picking
and see the pickings related to the invoice.

As the invoincing flow has changed in odoo version 9,
invoices linked to pickings (and vice versa), are shown independently from
the invoicing method
