===============================================
Link between the invoice and its source picking
===============================================

This module adds a link between pickings and generated invoices.
So that user can easily reach the invoice related to the picking
and see the pickings related to the invoice. This only applies
on the invoices generated from pickings.

It also changes invoicing state in picking according to the related
invoices. And it blocks deleting an invoice if it has pickings that
have not been cancelled.
