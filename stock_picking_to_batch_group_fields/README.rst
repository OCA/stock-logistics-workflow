Use Cases / Context
===================

Currently this module
`stock_picking_batch_extended <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/16.0/stock_picking_batch_extended>`__
includes this functionality but to make it work it is necessary to
activate the OCA batches, which forces to use other behaviours than
Odoo's for the picking batches.

It will be useful for you if you want to make the grouping of pickings
manually using any field of the delivery note.

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Operations.
2. Activate Batch Transfers

5. Choose add to **a new batch transfer** and check **Group by fields**
6. Select the fields you want to group by.
