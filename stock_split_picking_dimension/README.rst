This module extends the functionality of the stock_split_picking module
to allow the user to split the picking by dimensions to ensure that the
contents of the picking to process will not exceed a certain volume
and/or weight and/or number of lines.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When dealing with large quantities of products, it could be useful to be
able to split the picking into multiple pickings to simplify the picking
process and improve the efficiency of the warehouse. Some times, the
picking you would like to process is too large to be picked in one go or
too heavy to be carried by one person or contains too many different
products to be picked in one go.

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Inventory** dashboard and open any picking.

#. If picking state is **available** you can see an split button.

#. If you click on **Split** button, a wizard will open.

#. The wizard will let you choose the way you want to split the picking.

#. To split by dimension, select **By Dimension** option.

#. Enter the values for **Volume**, **Weight** and **Number of Lines**.
(You can leave any of the fields empty if you don't want to split by
that dimension).

#. Click on **Split** button.

#. The current picking will be split into two different pickings. The
first picking will contain the lines that fit the dimensions you
entered. The second picking will contain the remaining lines.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  The split by dimension only split at the move level. In other words,
   if a move has 10 units of a product with a weight of 1kg, the wizard
   will not split the move in different pickings even if a weight of 5kg
   is requested as max weight by picking.
