This module adds a field on stock picking that will check if all movements have
been filled in by stock operator.

This is helpful to see if at least all lines of the picking have been treated.
The picking would not be marked as ready if some quantities stay at 0 (backorders) and
quantities are < the reserved one.

Usage
=====

#. On a picking, do the stock operations as normally, filling in the done quantities.
#. At least when the last operation is filled in with a quantity equal or greater
   than the demand quantity, the field 'is_completed' == True and a green banner
   is displayed on picking form side.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The 'is_completed' status field is not updated until picking is not saved.

This is due to how the framework is managing computed fields that are not
stored. In fact, the field on which we fill in the quantity is
'move_ids_without_package' and not 'move_line_ids' nor 'move_ids', so
the compute is not triggered.

It seems that adding it in the depends() solved the interface refresh when
we change the line quantity. But this introduces a warning in the log
as we depends on a non stored field ('move_ids_without_package').
