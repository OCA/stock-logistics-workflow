Stock Route Sales Teams
=======================

Allows to configure a Route according to a sales team.

 * An option on the Routes defines if the route can be used on sales
   teams or not
 * A new option on a sales team allows to choose the Route to use
   for their sales (the procurements will use this route, except if
   another one has been set on the lines)

Configuration
=============

The configurations available for this module are:

 * In `Warehouse > Configuration > Routes`, you can select which routes are
   available for the sales teams
 * In `Sales > Sales Teams`, you can optionally choose a route that will be
   used for a team

Usage
=====

As soon as a sales order is created and its sales team has a route, the
procurements will use this route.
