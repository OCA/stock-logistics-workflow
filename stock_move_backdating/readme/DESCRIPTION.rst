This module allows to register old stock moves (with date != now).
On each operation, user can specify the **Actual Movement Date**, that will be
used as movements date. That date can also be set by using the button **Fill Actual Movement Date**, shown in the header form when state is *Partially Available* or *Available*. As a result, all operations get automatically filled in with the date chosen.
In addition, if *Perpetual inventory valuation* is enabled, the date of journal entries generated will be updated accordingly.

This module also allows to backdate inventory adjustments.
