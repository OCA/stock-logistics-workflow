The Source Document contains a text referencing to the Odoo document
from which the transfer has been created. This module replaces the
Source Document field for a field with the same label which is clickable
and redirects the user to the document.

If there is an existing Odoo document with the same name as the value in
the Source Document, the Odoo field is hidden, and the new field is
shown by default. Otherwise, it's left as it is.

It also adds the base strucuture in order to reference documents from
different Odoo models.
