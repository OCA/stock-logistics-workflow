This module allows to send the delivery notification to the carrier when
any operation before the delivery one is marked as done.

This is used mainly to send the notification when the pack operation is marked
as done, using the shipping method of the related delivery operation.
By doing so, the delivery operation won't send again the delivery notification
when it will be validated.
