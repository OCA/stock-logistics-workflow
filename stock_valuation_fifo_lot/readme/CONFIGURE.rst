Disable the 'Use Last Lot/Serial Cost for New Stock' setting under *Inventory >
Configuration > Settings*, which is enabled by default, to use the standard
`_get_price()` behavior instead of the lot cost, for receipts of specific lots/serials
with no link to a purchase order (i.e. customer returns and positive inventory
adjustments).
