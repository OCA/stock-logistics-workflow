Use Cases / Context
===================

Food wholesalers have very little time to fill all their trucks with the
goods that are planned to be sold on that day.

There is no time to waste when it comes to printing multiple delivery
notes and invoices. When it is done, it is necessary to print multiple
copies of these documents. It is faster to distribute them if they are
all together.

This module was developed to cover this or a similar use case, and
increase efficiency when filling many trucks.
