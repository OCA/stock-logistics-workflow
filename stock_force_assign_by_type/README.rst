This module provides additional functionality for stock allocation management in Odoo,
allowing you to force stock reservation based on the type of picking operation.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The background context for this module is that we need to pay for something that leaves
our warehouse (the supplier charges waste management fees), which is something not
supported by Odoo. So we need to:

* Make a purchase order from which we can generate a supplier invoice.
* Only an inbound picking will complete the quantities delivered (received) on the purchase order.
* Reserve the correct lots from our stock automatically as in a delivery picking
  (this is what this module allows us to do).
* To be able to reassign/unreserve as in a normal delivery. For that reason we overwrite the domain.

Configuration
=============

Picking operation type configuration:

* Go to Inventory -> Configuration -> Picking operation types.
* Create or edit the picking operation type you want to configure for forced stock reservation.
* Check the "Force reservation" checkbox if you want to make stock reservation mandatory
  for this type of picking operation.

Usage
=====

Effects of activating "Force reservation":

* Ensures that certain types of picking operations always reserve stock automatically.
* Makes related fields visible on picking forms to indicate if the stock reservation has been force reserved.
* Makes buttons visible on picking forms to allow cancellation and reallocation of stock reservation, providing greater flexibility in stock management.

How to use this module:

* Create purchase or sales orders as required in the relevant application ( Purchase or Sales).
* When you confirm an order, the system will make the stock reservation in the corresponding
  warehouse according to the reservation configuration in the associated picking operation type.
* If necessary, you can use the buttons on the picking forms to cancel or reallocate the stock reservation.
