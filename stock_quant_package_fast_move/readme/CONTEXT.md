Imagine that you need to transfer different packages between different locations in your warehouse.

Regular Odoo flow looks like this:

- Go to **Inventory -> Overview** and select an operation type (e.g., **Internal Transfer**).
- Create a corresponding picking.
- Add packages if **Move Entire Packages** is enabled or add all the package products.
- Set quantities done.
- Validate.


However, if you are working with packages, you will primarily operate from the **Packages** menu.

And it would be much more convenient if you could move packages directly from this menu.

This is what this module is designed for.
