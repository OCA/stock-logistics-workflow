This module simplifies package movement between different warehouse locations. 

You can simply select several packages and use a wizard that will perform all the underlying inventory operations.

NB: This module depends on the [Stock Picking Move Package to Another Package](https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/16.0/stock_picking_move_package_to_package) module.
You should configure it properly in case you want to use the **destination package** option.
