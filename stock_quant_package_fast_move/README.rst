This module simplifies package movement between different warehouse
locations.

You can simply select several packages and use a wizard that will
perform all the underlying inventory operations.

NB: This module depends on the `Stock Picking Move Package to Another
Package <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/16.0/stock_picking_move_package_to_package>`__
module. You should configure it properly in case you want to use the
**destination package** option.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Imagine that you need to transfer different packages between different
locations in your warehouse.

Regular Odoo flow looks like this:

-  Go to **Inventory -> Overview** and select an operation type (e.g.,
   **Internal Transfer**).
-  Create a corresponding picking.
-  Add packages if **Move Entire Packages** is enabled or add all the
   package products.
-  Set quantities done.
-  Validate.

However, if you are working with packages, you will primarily operate
from the **Packages** menu.

And it would be much more convenient if you could move packages directly
from this menu.

This is what this module is designed for.

Configuration
=============

-  Go to **Inventory -> Configuration -> Settings**.
-  Activate the **Packages** checkbox.
-  In the **Package Move Operation**, select the operation type that
   will be used for easy package transfers. Make sure that the **Move
   Entire Packages** checkbox is enabled. This setting is configured for
   each company separately.

Usage
=====

-  Go to **Inventory -> Products -> Packages**.

-  Open a package or select several packages in the list view.
   **Important**: All selected packages must be located in the same
   location.

-  Open the **Action** menu and select **Move packages**.

-  In the opened wizard, select the destination location where you want
   to move the packages.

-  You can select an optional destination package in the **Destination
   Package** field. If selected, the content of the selected packages
   will be moved into the destination package located at the destination
   location.

-  If you check **Validate**, the created internal picking will be
   validated. Otherwise, it will remain in the **Ready** state.

-  Click the **Move** button.
