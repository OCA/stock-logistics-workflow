This module is based on `picking_dispatch <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/8.0/picking_dispatch>`_
but reworked for matching Odoo new picking system (with pack operations).

Since v12 it is compatible with odoo addon https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/12.0/addons/stock_picking_batch/models/stock_picking_batch.py
It allows to define which approach for batch handling will be used per company.

Batch picking allows you to manage several pickings at the same time.
You can create a batch with all pickings selected or multiple batch depends on
a group field selected in wizard.

After having created a batch with a list of stock picking, you can:

* Check availability and reserve quants for all pickings
* Mark all pickings as done when delivery is done.
* Make partial delivery by filling done quantities in pack operations tab.
* Print a report to pick the proper goods at once
