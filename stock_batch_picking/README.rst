Stock Batch Picking
===================

This module is based on `picking_dispatch <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/8.0/picking_dispatch>`_
but reworked for matching Odoo 9 new picking system (with pack operations).

Batch picking allows you to manage several pickings at the same time.
After having created a batch with a list of stock picking, you can:
* Check availability and reserve quants for all pickings
* Mark all pickings as done when delivery is done.
* Make partial delivery by filling done quantities in pack operations tab.
* Print a report to pick the proper goods at once
