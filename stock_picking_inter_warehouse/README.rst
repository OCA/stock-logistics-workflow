This module allows to set up an operation type dedicated to internal transfers between different warehouses in the same company, managing both delivery and receipt from each side of the transfer.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Enable multi-step routes and location
* In warehouse, enable flag “Inter-warehouse transfers” and set:
    * receipt destination location (eg: “WH2/Stock”)
    * receipt operation type (eg: “WH2: Receipts”)
    * partner in picking (eg: “My Company (San Francisco), WH2”)
* Note: this must be done for all warehouses sending or receiving internal transfers.
* Create or open an existing “internal” operation type; enable field “Use for Inter-warehouse transfer”.
* Boolean "Disable Merge Picking Moves" is also available if you wish to maintain a 1 to 1 relation between outgoing pickings and incoming ones.

Usage
=====

Create a transfer for “inter-warehouse” operation type:

- when selecting contact related to receiving warehouse, destination location is automatically selected
- on picking validation, a “receipt” picking is created in the destination warehouse.
