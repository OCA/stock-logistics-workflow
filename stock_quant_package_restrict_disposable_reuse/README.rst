This module restricts the reuse of disposable packages by not allowing to select them in stock
move lines after they have already been allocated in a delivery.

This restriction can be activated or deactivated at package type level. So the user can select
for each package type if the disposable packages can be reused or not.

Note: This module will be incompatible with any module that modifies the stock.move.line package_id
or result_package_id fields domain.

Usage
=====

* Create a package and set the "package_use" to disposable.
* Create a package type with "restrict_reuse" to true and assign it to your package.
* Use the package in a delivery.
* Create another transfer and try to select the same package.
  You will see that it does not appear anymore on the list.
