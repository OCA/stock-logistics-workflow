This module allows to help user defining a backorder reason when it is
launched on picking validation. This reason will be written on picking chatter level.

A reason can have several backorder strategy to apply:

  * Create: Create the backorder
  * Cancel: Cancel the backorder
  * Use Partner Configuration: On partner level, you can define which strategy to
    apply and for which flow (Sale: Create/Cancel, Purchase: Create/Cancel)

This behaviour can be activated on picking type level.

Moreover, on company level, you can set default reason strategy for new partners.
