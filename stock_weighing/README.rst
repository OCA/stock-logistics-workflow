Use Cases / Context
===================

Some bussiness must weigh their operations in order to process them. For
example in fresh product factories where the demand could not fit the
exact a amount of delivered product and that depends on the final
operation weight.

Configuration
=============

You need to configure an operation type so its operations show up in the
weighing assistant.

To do so:

1. Go to *Configuration > Operations Types* and choose the one you want
   to configure.
2. Set *Weighing operations* on.
3. You can choose your desired *Weighing lable report*.
4. If you want to print your labels automatically, set *Print weighing
   label* on.

If you don't have any product with units of measure of the weight
category, you'll have to add some.

-  Allow to show the units of measure in your config settings if isn't
   ready yet.
-  Add some products with a unit of measure of the weight category
   (kilograms, grams, etc.).
-  Place some pending operations for those products.

Usage
=====

You've got several ways to start weighing pending operations:

**From the app menu**

1. Go to the app menu an click on *Weighing*
2. You'll be presented with your weighing options (Incoming, Outgoing or
   more if a third module extends it)
3. You can start weighing.

**From a weighing operation type**

1. Go to *Inventory > Overview*.
2. Those operation types with *weighing operation* active will show a
   button with the pending ones.
3. Click on it and you can start weighing.

**From a picking**

1. In any picking with weighing operations, you can click on the smart
   button and start processing them.

Using the assitant
------------------

You'll be presented with a list of operations to weigh. To weigh them,
just press the red circle button to record a new weight:

-  If there's only one detailed operation reserved, a popup will show up
   to record the operation weight.
-  If there are several, you'll enter the detailed view and you'll be
   able to weigh every detailed operation.
-  If you just want to weigh one, you can force the operation as done
   using the checkmark button.

You can reset your weighing using the cross button. You can print the
label on demand using the printer button. You can add a new detailed
operation using the plus button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This PR should be https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/161042 merged in
   order to reload the kanban view properly after each action. Otherwise
   we should reimplement the whole core method in our override.
