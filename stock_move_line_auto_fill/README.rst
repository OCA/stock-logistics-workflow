This module alows to auto fill quantities in picking operations and autoassignment
lots quantities.

In Odoo, if you schedule to transfer 50 products and only receive 49, you have
to change the quantity directly on the picking.
As the quantity by default is 0 for each line, you have to write the received
quantity on 49 lines.

In this module we have added a button that helps users to fill automatically
the scheduled quantities. Then, the user can just change back the quantities
for the product that hasn't been received yet.

Products with lots
==================
When working with lots, it's very uncomfortable to introduce the quantity,
lot by lot, when transferring pickings from your warehouse (outgoing or
internal).

This module automatically assigns the reserved quantity as the done one, so
that you only have to change it in case of divergence, but having the
possibility of transferring directly.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Make sure you have selected the proper removal strategy on your product
   categories.
#. Configure the product on the page "Inventory", field "Tracking" with one of
   these values: "By Unique Serial Number" or "By Lots" if you want autoassign
   lots.
#. Check in Operation type if you want auto assign quantities, by default if
   you want assign quantities done to reserved quantities you must push the
   button "Auto Fill" when the picking is in ready state and has move lines
#. Check in Operation type if you do not want auto assign lots quantities with
   "Avoid auto-assignment of lots".

Usage
=====

Set options in operation types, you can set 'Auto fill operation' what make
autoassignment button invisible and fill the quantities in operations for lines
and 'Avoid Autoassignment Lots' what allow fill manually the lots quantities.

Products without tracking lots
==============================
After confirming the picking, click on `Auto fill operations` button. The
Operations matching the following conditions will be filled automatically:

* The operation has not be processed (i.e `qty_done == 0`).
* The operation has no package set (i.e `package_id` is empty).

Product with lots
=================
#. Create an outgoing or an internal picking.
#. Include one product with lots and with enough stock.
#. Click on "Mark as Todo" button, and then on "Reserve".
#. Clicking on the icon with the three items bullet list on the "Operations"
   tab you will see that the quantities have been auto-assigned on the "Done"
   column.
