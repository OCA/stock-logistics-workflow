To use this module:

#. Go in a Picking type operation and enable `Use available lots`, which automatically enable `Use existing lots`, and/or `Use location lots`.
#. Go to an open picking or a scrap with products that are tracked by lots, which uses the Picking operation type above.
#. When you enter detailed operations you will notice that the lots available to select are filtered by available qty and the origin of the operation, depending on the option enabled in the picking type.
