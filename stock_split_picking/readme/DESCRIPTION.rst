This module adds a "Split" button on the outgoing pickings form.

It works like the classical picking Transfer but it leaves both pickings
(picking and its backorder) as confirmed without processing the transfer.

You can also choose to put all moves into separate pickings, or select moves
to be put into a new picking.
