This module adds a "Split" button on the outgoing pickings form.

It works like the classical picking Transfer but it leaves both pickings
(picking and its backorder) as confirmed without processing the transfer.

You can also choose to put all moves into separate pickings, or select moves
to be put into a new picking.

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Inventory** dashboard and open any picking.
#. If picking state is **available** you can see an split button.
#. On the "Operations" tab, fill the field "Done" to the quantity you want to
   split for each line.
#. If you click on **Split** button, wizard will split current picking into
   two different pickings depends on quantity done you entered above.
#. Both pickings remain confirmed.
#. When splitting a picking in an unassigned state, wizard won't
   be auto completed with picking lines.
