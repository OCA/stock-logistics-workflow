=============
Split picking
=============

This module adds a "Split" button on the outgoing pickings form.

It works like the classical picking Transfer but it leaves both pickings
(picking and its backorder) as confirmed without processing the transfer.

Installation
============

This module only needs `stock` module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to **Inventory** dashboard and open any picking.
#. If picking state is not **done** or **cancelled** you can see an split
button.
#. Clicking the button will display a wizard in which you can fill in the
   quantities you want to split for each line.
#. If you click on **Split** button, the wizard will split current picking into
   two different pickings depending on quantity you entered in the previous step.
#. Both pickings remain confirmed.
