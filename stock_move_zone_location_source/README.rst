This module allows to identify the source picking zone where products come from.
e.g. : A move flow Pick Stock > Pack > Ship. The ship move will contain the 'Pick Stock'
as source.

This is particularily useful if you have several stock zones and want to identify
that origin in further moves.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure the stock location(s) that should be identified as source for 
later moves:

#. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Locations (after having configured
   Storage Locations in 'Inventory > Configuration > Settings')
#. Select the ones you want to identify as source(s) by checking the 
   'Is Considered As Source' box.

Usage
=====

After having configured a flow that have several moves coming from different stock
zones, you'll be able to see the location zone origin.
