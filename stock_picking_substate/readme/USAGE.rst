#. Go to ** Settings > Technical > Database Structure ** and Add "Base substate".
    If necessary you can add "target State values" (ex define a substate for "cancel" state).
    Substate sequence is very important.
#. Create a stock picking and check if the substate are displayed on the header of
   form view. Check if you can't set a substate defined for pickings if it is not cancelled.
