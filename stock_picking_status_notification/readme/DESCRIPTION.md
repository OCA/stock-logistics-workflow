This module allows to send notifications to selected backend users when the state of stock picking changes . For this configurable notification rules are used. Rules are checked using flexible patterns. The first one rule matching the pattern is triggered.

By default notifications are sent when a picking is set to the "Waiting" or "Ready" status. However you can enable notifications for other pickings too.
