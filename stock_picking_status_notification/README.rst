This module allows to send notifications to selected backend users when
the state of stock picking changes . For this configurable notification
rules are used. Rules are checked using flexible patterns. The first one
rule matching the pattern is triggered.

By default notifications are sent when a picking is set to the "Waiting"
or "Ready" status. However you can enable notifications for other
pickings too.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Imagine you have a warehouse that is serving a retail store and online
shop.

Each time a sale is done in the retail shop you would like to process
that order immediately. For this you need to notify selected employees
about such order so that they could switch to it **asap**.

Configuration
=============

To configure notification rules:

-  Go to
   ``"Inventory -> Configuration -> Warehouse Management -> New Picking Notifications"``
   and create a new notification
-  Put the following data in the notification form:

   -  ``Priority``. Defines the order in which notification rules are
      checked. The lower is the number the higher is the priority.
      Default is ``10``
   -  ``Operation Types``, required. Specifies the operation types for
      which this notification will be triggered
   -  ``Notified Users``, required. List of users to be notified
   -  ``Source Document Pattern``, optional. Notification will be sent
      if source document name matches the specified regex pattern. Leave
      blank to match any source
   -  ``Custom Message``, optional. Custom message to be used instead of
      the default one. Leave blank to use the default message
   -  ``Notification Sound``, optional. Custom sound to be used with
      notification. Leave blank to use notification without sound
   -  ``Draft`` - optional. If enabled, notifications will be sent when
      a picking is in the "Draft" state
   -  ``Waiting Another Operation`` - optional. If enabled,
      notifications will be sent when a picking is in the "Waiting
      Another Operation" state
   -  ``Waiting`` - optional. If enabled, notifications will be sent
      when a picking is in the "Waiting" state
   -  ``Ready`` - optional. If enabled, notifications will be sent when
      a picking is in the "Ready" state.
   -  ``Done`` - optional. If enabled, notifications will be sent when a
      picking is in the "Done" state.
   -  ``Cancel`` - optional. If enabled, notifications will be sent when
      a picking is in the "Cancelled" state

Usage
=====

When a new picking is created and this picking matches some notification
rule a notification will be shown for selected users:
