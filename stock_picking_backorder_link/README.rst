Improves the connection between linked pickings if the setting
Stock Picking Backorder Link is enabled, then:

If a picking is validated with less qty than expected and you don't
create a backorder, the previous moves still to do in a backorder can be
automatically cancelled as you "will not need" the remaining quantities.
Also lowers the dest moves qty.

If you cancel a Backorder it will cancel the origin moves related as
you "will not need" the remaining quantities.
