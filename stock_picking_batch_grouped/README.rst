Manage product quantities in batch transfers.

In the batch transfer there will be a new tab that shows the products moved by the transfer.

Each line in the `Products` tab represents a group of one or more move lines in the batch transfer: these grouped lines share the values shown in each `Product` line (`From`, `To`, ...).

The fields to group by can be extended by other modules.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Set the `Done Quantity` in a line of the new `Products` tab: this will propagate the input value to the linked move lines.

The input value is split so that the `Done Quantity` in the grouped move lines is filled sequentially from the oldest.
