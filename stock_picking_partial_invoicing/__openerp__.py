Stock picking partial invoicing
===============================

This module was written to extend the invoicing capabilities of Odoo,
and allows users to create customer or supplier invoices for part of
a delivered Order or received Incoming Shipment.


Installation
============

No additional installation instructions are required.


Configuration
=============

This module does not require any additional configuration.

Usage
=====

When the user wants to create an invoice for a Delivery Order or
Incoming Shipment she/he can indicate which moves should be invoiced,
and what quantity to invoice.

If the system identifies that the stock move has been fully invoiced, it
will change the corresponding status.

If the user deletes the invoice or an invoice line, or reduces the quantity
to be invoiced, the corresponding stock move changes to the status 'To be
invoiced'.

The user is not allowed to invoice more quantity than what exists in the
corresponding stock move.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

No issues have been identified.
