This module allows to trace the usage of stock valuation layer. That is,
makes it possible to identify in what stock moves was a given valuation layer
used, and how much quantity was taken by the particular stock move.

This kind of traceability is important in case that at some point you want
to conduct an revaluation (for example, in case that the purchase order price
changes after the products have been received into stock).
