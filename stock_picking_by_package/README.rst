Odoo Packages allow a Picking to record that some items were packaged together.
They are not transfereable storage item themselves.

If, for example, on reveiving, items were put together in a package,
you might need on a later Delivery or Transfer to pick that package.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Enable the Packages option, on Inventory / Configuration / Settings.

On Delivery operation type, recommended configuration is:

* Move entire Packages: checked (required)
* Reservation Method: Manually
  (recommended, in case you want to manually pick the Lot/Serial#)
* Show Detailed Operations: unchecked (recommended)

Usage
=====

On a Stock Transfer, Operations tab:

* On the packages list, add the Packages to pick
* Click on "Check Availability".
  You might need to click before on "Unreserve",
  in case an automatic reservation was done.

The selected Package quants will then be used and assigned
by the "Check Availability" reservation process.
