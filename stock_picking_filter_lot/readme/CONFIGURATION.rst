By default, all operation types use filter on lots, should you want to disable this for a particular operation type, follow the next steps :
- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types.
- Unselect "Use only available lots" for all the operation types on which you want to disable filtering.

In case you can receive a second time the same lot number (from supplier for instance), this filter should not be applied on Reception.
