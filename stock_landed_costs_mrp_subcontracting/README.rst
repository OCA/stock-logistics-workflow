This module allows to apply landed costs to the manufactured product
resulting from a subcontracted operation when the user indicates in the
landed cost the picking where the product was received into the warehouse
stock from the subcontracting location.

The normal thing to do would be for the user to indicate the subcontracting
manufacturing order in the landed cost, but this manufacturing order is
hidden to the user. So it's better in practical terms to let the user choose
the picking where the product was received into stock after the subcontracting
operation.

Usage
=====

Create a landed cost and indicate the picking where the product was received
into the warehouse stock from the subcontracting location. The landed costs
will then be applied to the valuation layers associated to the stock move
of the subcontracting manufacturing order.
