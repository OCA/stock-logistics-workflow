        Add a special view and wizard on product to check the validity of each
        stock product, with an amount of depreciation. Your finance can now
        take in charge a factor for each product, based on the depreciation
        value for each product. You can set the depreciation value based on the
        out of stock amount for each product for the last 12/24 months.
        Important: this module does not offer a way to change
        product depreciation.
