Log in as a portal user. There will be a new "Stock operations" menu in the list of available documents.

Open a document. Following information is shown on the page:

* Document name (number)
* Document date
* Delivery address
* List of items:

  * Product name
  * Quantity

You can create a direct link to a stock picking so that even a non user can sign it.
To do it:

#. Open the picking form and click "Generate signature link".
#. Copy the link and share it.

Be careful when sharing this link: anyone with the link will have access to the document.
