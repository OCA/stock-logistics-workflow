Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you would like your customers to be able to see their stock operations in the customer portal.
For example if they would like to check statuses of their delivery orders.

Configuration
=============

* Go to "Inventory -> Configuration -> Settings" and scroll to the "Operation" section.
* In the "Portal Visible Operations" select operation types that would be visible in the customer portal.

Usage
=====

Log in as a portal user. There will be a new "Stock operations" menu in the list of available documents.

Open a document. Following information is shown on the page:

* Document name (number)
* Document date
* Delivery address
* List of items:

  * Product name
  * Quantity

You can create a direct link to a stock picking so that even a non user can sign it.
To do it:

#. Open the picking form and click "Generate signature link".
#. Copy the link and share it.

Be careful when sharing this link: anyone with the link will have access to the document.
