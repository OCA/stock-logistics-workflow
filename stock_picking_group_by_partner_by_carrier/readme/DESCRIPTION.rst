This module can be used if your customers expect that several different orders
they passed will be shipped in a single delivery order.

With this module installed, when a sale order is confirmed, the stock moves for
the lines of the sale order can be placed in an existing delivery order that
shares the same delivery address and carrier (or lack thereof).

Sale orders with a Shipping Policy set to 'When all products are ready' always
get their own shipping.
