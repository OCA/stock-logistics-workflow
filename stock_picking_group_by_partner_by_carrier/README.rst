This module can be used if your customers expect that several different orders
they passed will be shipped in a single delivery order.

With this module installed, when a sale order is confirmed, the stock moves for
the lines of the sale order can be placed in an existing delivery order that
shares the same delivery address and carrier (or lack thereof).

Sale orders with a Shipping Policy set to 'When all products are ready' always
get their own shipping.

When the delivery slip is printed, the list of pending quantities to deliver
is shown at the end, grouped by order.

The grouping can also be applied in case of external resupply. Moves at the
destination of the same delivery address defined on the resupply stock rule
will be grouped in a same delivery order.

Note: The grouping is currently not propagated to the pulled internal moves if
you don't use the module stock_available_to_promise_release in the wms
repository.

Usage
=====

To use this module you need to enable grouping on the picking types for which you want grouping.

If you want to enable this for the shippings of a warehouse:

* be sure that in the settings of the Inventory app, you checked "Manage Push
  and Pull inventory flows"
* enable "debug mode"
* go to the warehouse for which you want grouping and check the setting "Group
  Shippings"


You can also enable this for individual picking types by checking the setting
"Group Pickings" on the picking type view.
