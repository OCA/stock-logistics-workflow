As stock inventories take place asynchronously from stock common operations, it is
better to declare losses at the moment the operator try to transfer product quantities.
He usually has the direct vision on stock level at that moment and can declare losses
easily.

If real-time accounting is enabled, this can help to reduce unwanted stock movements as
we'll reserve the possible loss quantities in a new assigned picking, confirm or cancel
loss in a second time.
