- You need to have enabled the 'Show Detailed Operations' on the Picking type(s) you
  want.
- Go to Inventory > Operations > Transfers
- Choose the one you want to manage.
- In the 'Detailed Operations' tab, fill in the done quantities as usual.
- If for one line, you don't find physically the whole product quantity, you'll be able
  to declare the loss for the difference between the reserved one and the done one.
- To do so, fill in the found quantity in Done column, then click on 'Loss' button.
- The reserved quantity will be equal to the done quantity and a Loss picking is waiting
  for a check on the 'Loss' picking type.

- That loss picking is now reserving the possible missing quantity in order to avoid
  another picking that want to take a quantity that possibly does not exist anymore.
- Then, an operator can decide to validate the inventory loss or to cancel the picking.
