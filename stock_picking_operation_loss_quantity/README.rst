This module allows to declare loss product quantities during picking
operations.

To avoid unwanted stock losses if it is not justified, movements will be
reaffected to another picking type.

This module take into account the flows with product lot management,
packages, owners.

Use Cases / Context
===================

As stock inventories take place asynchronously from stock common
operations, it is better to declare losses at the moment the operator
try to transfer product quantities. He usually has the direct vision on
stock level at that moment and can declare losses easily.

If real-time accounting is enabled, this can help to reduce unwanted
stock movements as we'll reserve the possible loss quantities in a new
assigned picking, confirm or cancel loss in a second time.

Configuration
=============

-  Go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse
-  Enable 'Storage Locations' and 'Multi-Step Routes'.
-  Go To Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses
-  On the selected Warehouse, check the 'Enable the Loss feature' under
   'Loss' section.

Usage
=====

-  You need to have enabled the 'Show Detailed Operations' on the
   Picking type(s) you want.

-  Go to Inventory > Operations > Transfers

-  Choose the one you want to manage.

-  In the 'Detailed Operations' tab, fill in the done quantities as
   usual.

-  If for one line, you don't find physically the whole product
   quantity, you'll be able to declare the loss for the difference
   between the reserved one and the done one.

-  To do so, fill in the found quantity in Done column, then click on
   'Loss' button.

-  The reserved quantity will be equal to the done quantity and a Loss
   picking is waiting for a check on the 'Loss' picking type.

-  That loss picking is now reserving the possible missing quantity in
   order to avoid another picking that want to take a quantity that
   possibly does not exist anymore.

-  Then, an operator can decide to validate the inventory loss or to
   cancel the picking.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Enable loss feature on stock.move level too if 'Detailed Operations'
   feature is disabled.
