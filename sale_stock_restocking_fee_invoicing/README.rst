This module extends the functionality of the stock picking return wizard
to allow you to charge restocking fee in case of return of goods by a
customer.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

The product used to charge restocking fee on the sale order must be specified
into the stock settings form which can be reached by:

* *Settings* - *Inventory* - *Valuation*
* or *Inventory* - *Configuration* - *Settings* - *Valuation*

Once there you can change the item Restocking Fee Product.

nb: You may need to install sale_management to ease your test (SO view)

Usage
=====

Once installed, A check box is added on the stock return wizard to specify if
restocking fee must be charged. The same field is added on each line into
the wizard. You are therefore able to choose to charge for all the goods
returned or select which line should be charged.

By default no restocking fee are charged in case of customer return. If you
want to charge restocking fee you can:

* Specify on the customer contact form that restocking fee must be charged by
  default in case of return of goods. This value is used as default value into
  the stock return wizard;
* Use the checkboxes into the stock return wizard.

For each returned product, if restocking fee must be charged, once the return
picking is done, a new line is added into the origin sale order to charge fees.
The quantity charged is always 1 whatever the number of items of the same
product returned.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add support for different restocking fee policy. In the current
  implementation a fixed price by returned products line is charged. It would
  be nice to be able to select an other restocking fee policy. For example
  the restocking fee could be based on a percentage of the value of goods
  returned.
