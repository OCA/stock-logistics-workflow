To use this module, you need to:

Check 'Purchase on No Backorder' field of the desired supplier you want to purchase all unserved items.
Receive a partially incoming picking selecting "No Backorder" option.
The backorder will be cancelled (as expected) and new procurements will be created to purchase the cancelled items
(for those products with purchase routes)
